        <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
        <p>I am a Software Developer with more than 1-year of programming experience with Java, Python. Full-stack web development experience with VUE, Node.js & React.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Spring framework. Database system experience with SQL, Hibernate, AWS RDS, Git/Bash.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University and expect to graduate in early 2023. Actively seeking for Fall SDE internship in 2022.</p>          
        <p>Before switching gear, I am an architectural designer, I am a quick learner, I like learning new things constantly. I am an achiever, I never missed any deadline on my projects and have won several competitions with my team when I was an architect. I am really excited about making this big move and look forward to working with all the talented engineers in the future.</p>
