 # Project 1 - Andi Dong's Personal Website

* What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?

`The most challenging part for this assignment would be combine the nav bar with the mobile friendly design. It almost takes me more than four hours to figure it out. I have some experience on how to make it by using react.js or bootstrap or even vue.js, but I cannot make it pretty by just using HTML and CSS.`

* What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

`I made all the width 100% to fit all the size of the screen. and also add settings on media part. And for the nav bar, it's super hard to make it fit every size of the screen, so I think it for a long time, and I finally made it with changing the height to 100% as well.`

* What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

`I am really proud of the general layout and each page's layout, I am trying to fit everything in one screen without scrolling. However, For the projects, I really cannot, so i am happy that I found a way to fit them together well.`

* Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?

`For now, I don't have a blog for myself and a github resources for all of my projects. If I have more time, I'll add them on my website for sure.Also, the home page is very important, I'll definitely make it better if I have more time. At last, I think I'll add a interactive place on my website in the future.`

* How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

`At least 15 hours.`
